# Dapr in Action: A Simple Example to Get You StartedÂ ðŸš€

This repository contains a simple C# demo app that demonstrates the power of Dapr for microservices ([Blog Post](https://medium.com/p/50209c03c704/edit)). The app consists of two ASP.NET Core Web API services and a C# Console App. The first service generates a random number, and the second one squares it. We use Dapr for service invocation and state management.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)
- [Dapr CLI](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/)

## Project Structure

- **NumberGenerator**: An ASP.NET Core Web API service that generates a random number.
- **SquaringService**: An ASP.NET Core Web API service that squares a given number.
- **DaprExampleApp**: A C# Console App that invokes the two services and saves the generated number and its square using Dapr's state management

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Westmorland/NumberGenerator.git
cd NumberGenerator
```

2. Run the Number Generator service with Dapr:
Open a terminal, navigate to the `NumberGenerator` folder, and run the following command:

```
dapr run --app-id numbergenerator --app-port 7000 --dapr-http-port 3500 dotnet run
```

3. Run the Squaring Service with Dapr:
Open a new terminal, navigate to the SquaringService folder, and run the following command:

```
dapr run --app-id squaringservice --app-port 7001 dotnet run
```

4. Run the Console App:
Open a third terminal, navigate to the DaprExampleApp folder, and run the following command:

```
dotnet run
```

5. Check the output:
You should see the generated number and its square printed to the console.

## Using the App
The Console App performs the following steps:

1. It generates a random number by invoking the `NumberGenerator` service using Dapr's service invocation API.
2. It squares the generated number by invoking the `SquaringService` using Dapr's service invocation API.
3. It saves the generated number and its square using Dapr's state management API.
